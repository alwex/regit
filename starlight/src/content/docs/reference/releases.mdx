## Start a release

```bash
regit release start [version]
```

:::note
Only one release branch can exist at a time.
:::

Version is optional. If no version is provided, the next version will be decided based on the current version by bumping the minor version.

## Open an existing release

```bash
regit release start
```

Will open the existing release branch.

## release Status

```bash
regit release status
```

Will show status for the current release and show what feature are included.

## Adding features to a release

Once a release has been created, you can add features to it.

### Add single feature

```bash
regit release add <feature-name>
```

### Add multiple features

```bash

regit release add
```

## Finish a release

```bash
regit release finish
```

This will merge the release branch into the stable branch and create a tag for the release. Then cleanup the release branch and all feature included.

## Remove a release

```bash
regit release remove
```
