Preview branches can be seen as a staging environment for your features. They are useful for testing and reviewing features before they are merged into the stable branch.

## Start a preview

```bash
regit preview start <preview-name>
```

## Open a preview

```bash
regit preview start [preview-name]
```

If no preview name is provided, you will be prompted to start from an existing preview.

## List previews

```bash
regit preview list
```

Will list all previews in the current repository and show what features are included in each preview.

## Preview Status

```bash
regit preview status <preview-name>
```

Will show status for the specified preview and show what feature are included.

## Adding features to a preview

Once a preview has been created, you can add features to it.

### Add single feature

```bash
regit preview add <preview-name> <feature-name>
```

### Add multiple features

```bash

regit preview add <preview-name>
```

## Remove a preview

```bash
regit preview remove <preview-name>
```
